            <h2>About Paul Kagame</h2>
    
<p><B><I>Early Life and Education</B></I></p>
<p>A young Kagame had to escape with his family to Uganda during his childhood after Tutsis became targets of ethnic violence. His childhood took place in Uganda where he subsequently enrolled at Makerere University in Kampala1.

During his time in the National Resistance Army (NRA) Paul joined forces with Yoweri Museveni and received military training in Uganda. After his education Kagame enrolled at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College located in Kansas1.

<p><B><I>Rise to Power</B></I></p>
During 1987 Kagame became involved with the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) so they could stop the Tutsi community oppression in Rwanda. His position as RPF leader followed the murder of Fred Rwigyema who had headed the organization in 1990.

A rebel invasion by the RPF during 1990 caused Rwanda to experience civil war. The Rwandan genocide began in April 1994 following the ceasefire in 1993 until President Juvénal Habyarimana's assassination in that same month2.

Kagame commanded the RPF military forces to confront genocide perpetrators until approximately 500,000 to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus lost their lives. The Revolutionary and Patriotic Front seized control of Kigali and brought an end to genocide in July 1994.
